# Avoiding Long-Term Planning

In the fast-paced world of business and product development, it's easy to get caught up in the idea of long-term planning. However, Jason Fried, the co-founder of 37 Signals, believes that **long-term planning is a fantasy**. Instead, he advocates for a more adaptable and flexible approach to business and product design.

## The Problem with Long-Term Planning

Long-term planning can be problematic for several reasons:

- It's based on assumptions and predictions that may not hold true in the future
- It can lead to inflexibility and resistance to change
- It can prevent you from seizing new opportunities as they arise

As Jason puts it, "Long-term planning is what you thought. And like doing, figuring out as you go is what you think."

## Embracing Adaptability

Instead of relying on long-term plans, Jason suggests focusing on shorter time horizons and embracing adaptability. At 37 Signals, they think about things six weeks at a time and adjust as needed.

### Step 1: Focus on the Present

Concentrate on the tasks and challenges at hand, rather than trying to predict the future. Make decisions based on the current reality and the information available to you.

### Step 2: Be Open to Change

Be willing to pivot and adjust your plans as new information becomes available. Don't be afraid to abandon ideas that no longer serve you or your customers.

### Step 3: Iterate and Improve

Continuously iterate and improve upon your products and processes. Use feedback from customers and data from your business to inform your decisions and guide your path forward.
