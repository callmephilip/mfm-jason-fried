# Setting No Goals

In the world of business, setting goals is often seen as a crucial aspect of success. However, Jason Fried, co-founder of 37 Signals, challenges this notion by advocating for a goal-free approach. He believes that focusing on doing your best work consistently leads to better outcomes than setting arbitrary targets.

## The Problem with Goals

According to Jason, the main issue with setting goals is that they are often based on the person you are when you set them, not the person you will be when you reach them. This can lead to several problems:

- Goals can become outdated or irrelevant as circumstances change
- Pursuing goals can cause unnecessary stress and pressure
- Achieving goals may not bring the satisfaction or fulfillment you expected

As Jim Kudal, a friend of Jason's and the founder of Field Notes, once said, "The reason that most of us aren't happy most of the time is that we set goals, not for the person we're going to be when we reach them, but we set our goals for the person we are when we set them."

## Focusing on the Process

Instead of setting goals, Jason suggests focusing on the process of doing your best work consistently. By prioritizing the quality of your work and the value you provide, success becomes a natural byproduct rather than a target to aim for.

<Steps>
### Step 1
Identify what matters most in your work and what you want to achieve in the long term.

### Step 2
Break down your work into manageable tasks and projects that align with your overall vision.

### Step 3
Commit to doing your best work on each task and project, without attaching specific goals or metrics.

### Step 4
Regularly assess your progress and make adjustments as needed, but avoid setting rigid targets that may become outdated or counterproductive.
</Steps>

By following this process-oriented approach, you can maintain a sense of purpose and direction without the pressure of meeting arbitrary goals.

## The Benefits of a Goal-Free Approach

Embracing a goal-free philosophy can lead to several benefits, such as:

- Increased adaptability and resilience in the face of change
- Greater focus on the quality and impact of your work
- Reduced stress and anxiety associated with meeting targets
- More opportunities for creativity and innovation

As Jason explains in [Building a Low-Stress, Profitable Company](/building-a-profitable-company), 37 Signals has maintained profitability and low stress for over 25 years by prioritizing quality work and avoiding long-term planning. This approach has allowed them to stay agile and responsive to the needs of their customers and the market.

## Conclusion

While setting goals can be useful in certain situations, it's important to recognize that they are not always necessary or beneficial. By focusing on the process of doing your best work and maintaining a flexible mindset, you can achieve success on your own terms without the pressure of arbitrary targets.
