# The Importance of Wandering

In the fast-paced world of product development, it's easy to fall into the trap of rushing to build and launch a product without taking the time to explore and iterate on ideas. However, as Jason Fried and the team at 37 Signals have demonstrated, allowing time for wandering and exploration can be a crucial component of creating successful, innovative products.

## What is Wandering?

Wandering, in the context of product development, refers to the process of exploring and iterating on ideas before fully committing to a specific product direction. This can involve:

- Brainstorming and generating a wide range of potential ideas
- Prototyping and testing different concepts
- Gathering feedback from team members and potential users
- Refining and iterating on the most promising ideas

Wandering is not about aimlessly drifting without purpose, but rather intentionally creating space for creativity and exploration within the product development process.

## The Benefits of Wandering

By embracing the concept of wandering, product teams can:

1. **Uncover unique insights and opportunities:** Taking the time to explore a wide range of ideas increases the likelihood of discovering novel solutions and untapped market opportunities.

2. **Validate assumptions and mitigate risks:** Testing and iterating on ideas early in the process helps teams validate their assumptions and identify potential challenges before investing significant resources.

3. **Foster creativity and innovation:** Encouraging exploration and experimentation creates an environment that nurtures creativity and innovative thinking.

4. **Build team alignment and buy-in:** Involving team members in the wandering process helps build shared understanding and buy-in for the final product direction.

## How to Incorporate Wandering into Your Product Development Process

<Steps>

### Step 1: Create Space for Exploration

Set aside dedicated time and resources for your team to explore and iterate on ideas. This could be in the form of regular brainstorming sessions, hackathons, or even dedicated "wandering sprints."

### Step 2: Encourage Diverse Perspectives

Involve team members from different disciplines and backgrounds in the wandering process to ensure a wide range of perspectives and ideas are considered.

### Step 3: Prototype and Test Early

Create low-fidelity prototypes and test ideas with potential users as early as possible to gather feedback and validate assumptions.

### Step 4: Embrace Iteration

View wandering as an iterative process, where ideas are continually refined and improved based on feedback and insights gathered along the way.

By incorporating wandering into your product development process, you can create an environment that fosters creativity, innovation, and the discovery of unique, valuable product ideas. As Jason Fried and the team at 37 Signals have shown, taking the time to explore and iterate can be the key to building successful, impactful products.
