# Identifying What Needs to Exist

In his approach to product development, Jason Fried and the team at 37 Signals focus on identifying problems and opportunities that need to be addressed. This process involves a combination of intuition, observation, and a deep understanding of their target audience.

## The Problem-Solving Mindset

Fried and his team approach product development with a problem-solving mindset. They ask themselves questions like:

- What are the pain points our users are experiencing?
- What inefficiencies or frustrations exist in current solutions?
- How can we simplify or streamline existing processes?

By focusing on these questions, they can identify areas where a new product or feature could make a significant impact.

The key to identifying what needs to exist is to approach the process with empathy and a genuine desire to solve problems for your users.

## Observing and Listening

To identify potential opportunities, the team at 37 Signals engages in active observation and listening. This involves:

- Paying attention to customer feedback and support requests
- Analyzing user behavior and usage patterns within their existing products
- Engaging in conversations with their target audience to understand their needs and challenges

By gathering insights from these various sources, the team can develop a clearer picture of where they should focus their efforts.

## Trusting Intuition

While data and user feedback are essential, Fried also emphasizes the importance of trusting one's intuition when identifying what needs to exist. As experienced product designers and developers, the team at 37 Signals has developed a keen sense of what works and what doesn't.

Fried encourages his team to ask themselves questions like:

- Does this feel like a real problem that needs to be solved?
- Does our proposed solution align with our values and design principles?
- Are we excited and motivated to work on this project?

By combining data-driven insights with their own intuition and expertise, the team can make informed decisions about which projects to pursue.

## Examples from 37 Signals

Throughout their history, 37 Signals has successfully identified and addressed several key problems in the productivity and collaboration space. Some notable examples include:

- **Basecamp**: A project management tool that simplifies communication and organization for teams, addressing the complexity and feature bloat of existing solutions.
- **Hey**: An email service that tackles the overwhelming nature of traditional email inboxes by introducing features like the Imbox, The Feed, and Paper Trail.
- **Campfire**: One of the early real-time chat tools for teams, which identified the need for simple, persistent communication in the workplace.

In each of these cases, the team at 37 Signals identified a clear problem or opportunity and developed a focused, opinionated solution that resonated with their target audience.

By continually seeking out new problems to solve and trusting their instincts, Fried and his team have built a reputation for creating innovative, user-centered products.
